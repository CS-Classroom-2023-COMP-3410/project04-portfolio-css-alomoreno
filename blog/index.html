            <h2>Tweaking my portfolio.</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 18, 2025</p>
            <p>We just learned how to add CSS code to basic HTML to enhance the looks of a website. This is very exciting but is also a bit of a headache. 
            I spent a lot of time tweaking the colors, fonts, and layout to make sure everything looks just right. I also learned about the importance of responsive design, ensuring that my portfolio looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. It's been a challenging but rewarding experience, and I can't wait to apply these skills to future projects.

                <h2>First Day of Winter Quarter.</h2>
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 6, 2025</p>
                <p>Today was the first day back from winter break, and I started my  Web programming class. I'm very excited to see the progess I make in this class, and it will be a good addition to 
                    my resume. So far, we started off strong with using AI to build a basic starter HTML website. I'm excited to see what else we will be doing in this class.

                <h2>Flight Back to Denver.</h2>
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 5, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Today I flew back to Denver from Oklahoma City. I had a great time with my family and friends, but I'm excited to be back in Denver. I'm excited to see my friends and get back to my routine. 
                    I'm also excited to start my winter quarter classes tomorrow.
